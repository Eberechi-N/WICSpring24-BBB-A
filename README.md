Our group was inspired by the customizable skincare company Curology!
As we were brainstorming for our skincare-based project, we took notice to how Curology is unique in a way that it's customizable. It helped us decide that we wanted to make SkinSolutions unique as well.

SkinSolutions is a website that recommends skin products that are customizable to the user.
Once a user first enters the SkinSolutions site, they are allowed to take a questionnaire that asks about what the user is looking for in a skincare product. After completing the questionnaire, the user is recommend products based upon their answers.

We constructed our program using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
When constructing our website, we used a mixture of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also used the code editor VS Code for programming.

An issue that we had to overcome was the fact that we had little to no front-end programming experience.
We had to spend a lot of time learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub due to our lack of front-end developing experience. Overall, we had the most trouble in utilizing CSS. Also, during the brainstorming process, we had plans on implementing an API that would catalog the skincare products recommended to the user. Unfortunately, the API became unavailable, and we had to resort to hardcoding in products.

We're most proud of learning so much material in such a short period of time!
A big part of the development process was learning front-end programming as well as retracing our steps after facing an obstacle. However, we were able to overcome most of these hurdles and become decently skilled in front-end development.

We learned front-end development as well as how to get back on track after facing setbacks.
There were many times throughout development where we had to backtrack and regroup after facing an issue. Luckily we learned how to think critically in dire situations as well as learning how to overcome the large learning curve that we were faced with.

To help users of SkinSolutions develop a community, we want to implement a forum system that can help users communicate with each other.
A plan of ours that we unfortunately had to scrap was one that involved developing a forum on our site. This would allow users to discuss skincare problems as well as provide reviews for products. With due time, hopefully this concept becomes a reality!
