For national world health day, our group decided to make a website that would recommend users skincare products based upon their results on a questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask them a series of questions regarding skin issues they want to fix, price, and availability. After answering and submitting their questions, they are then shown a series of products that are configured to your answers. Along with this, the user can also chat with other users on a forum where they can discuss products and general skincare topics.
This project went out of all or our comfort zones due to all of us having little to no experience with front-end development. Between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, most of our group experienced the most difficulty with CSS. Also, during the brainstorming stage of our project, we planned on using an API that contained a database of skincare products. However, as we began development, we had come to realize that we were unable to utalize the API due to it becoming suddenly unavailable.
